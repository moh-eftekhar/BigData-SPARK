tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh me too, and it's such a simple fix :)
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh Apparently those big headphones (like they use at school) have magnets in them. His shunt his magnetic, so they cause it to reset!
tweets_blockaa:17145858	Tristan's shunt needed to be reset, after trying to figure out why it keeps resetting itself, we may have found the cause - headphones!

tweets_blockaa:17145858	@jonathanrknight you should do an Official Facebook FAN Page... nothing personal, but then the fakes would have competition! :)
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@MacsSTLsweetie Use a command like "Go Potty" every time... she will get the hang of it! Eventually she will go on command!
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@MacsSTLsweetie Crate her... when you cannot be keeping a close eye on her, put her in it, other times take her out every 30mins

tweets_blockaa:17145858	@dannywood That's because we all love your love tips... even my hubby is a fan! (And he is a strict non-nkotb fan!)
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh She did a post about RR, that's what started all this being out and everyone discussing it http://nkotbsummer.blogspot.com/
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh Some bought Gold packages because those proceeds were to goto charity for a bit at one point... did you read KT's blog?
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh RR has collected money for a few supposed charities, in exchange for a donation a drawing w/prize was supposed to happen
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh I actually thought they were just running things poorly till that point... now I feel more like it's a big old scam
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@allyeigh Yep that be it! The fact he is finding it simpler to reimburse charity money, rather than provide proof it went to charity...
tweets_blockaa:17145858	I think I should have just let hubby drive himself to his buddies, and been without the car... I am so tired now :(
tweets_blockaa:17145858	Came home and my dog acted like she had not seen me in months, kept throwing a fit till I laid down so she could lay down with me! LOL
tweets_blockaa:17145858	I am up, all so I can drive hubby 5mins to his buddy's house so they can carpool to work!

tweets_blockaa:17145858	@WheelchairMommy It just all blends in together, so It never really seems like i live in just the town my house is in...did that make sense?
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@JoeGrl_DdubTude My twitter slowed a lot when I quit following most BH on this account... It was kind of nice!
tweets_blockaa:17145858	@WheelchairMommy I replied hehe... And my town is not that teeny... OK maybe the town I live in is, but the area is not! LOL

tweets_blockaa:1441801	If I knew I was gonna be blown off this much for tutoring, I would have left for minnesota already.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@Psych_USA I am soooo psyched for the new season! Hehe
tweets_blockaa:1441801	I love how my cat likes to stand guard when I am in the bathroom. Like I will be attacked by invisible toilet paper monsters.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Now that I am 2 days behind on tutoring and have 10 plus labs to input, I'm thinking we may not finish before we leave. Not my fault!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Seriously....I am getting restless. And a little uneasy. Breath deep.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	Still waiting for tutoring. *sigh* just wasted my afternoon and parents did not even give me the courtesy of notice. Playing wow now grrr

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@Psych_USA Why can't Gus or Shawn ever stay with a girl long term?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@Psych_USA Why are there no Psych outs on the first season dvd?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	I wonder how far back we will push tutoring tonight. My bro never went to 2 sleepovers a week. Times have changed.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	Dear Weather Man: You lie! You say it's 87, cooler than yesterday, but it's really hotter, hence the sweatiness.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	Wow I was just retweeted by @thewbdotcom  ..... how cool is that?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@thewbdotcom just entered and would really like the PSP since our PS2 just broke! :)
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Twitter seems to be dropping some of my tweets that i should be receiving. Is that happening to anyone else?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@psych_USA is it @carltonlassiter or @det_lassiter ?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Woke up before corey which means...troll time on wow!

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@redbadger who knows. But we have drug dealers living behind us so that could have been them too.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@potatoduck I'm just against capitolists who come by their wealth dishonestly and knowingly take advantage of their employees

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@heartfeltmadnes yeah. And quite frankly it was little offputting to turn on wow and see people talking about it. Trying to escape darn it!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@heartfeltmadnes why? Because of MJ?

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@heartfeltmadnes we are waiting for your dad to talk to us. Apparently ian is complaining of us being too mean.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@heartfeltmadnes I think I might. Dealing with ian drama also...not good.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	Time to get in line. It's soooo long!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Pays to wait. This large family just grabbed handfuls of tanks and moved to another table to sort. I waited and grabbed their leftovers!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Now just looking at other stuff waiting for the line to go down. Love the oceans 11 music playing. It's very appropriate!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Got em! Was hoping for black in color but this family snatched practically everything in my size.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	Why did I do this by myself? A bad decision in hindsight I'm thinkin'.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	20 min. 20 min. Someone entertain me. I hate crowds.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Wonder if this is gonna be like guerilla warfare. A mad fight for th tanks! Thankfully only 5 per customer.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Already 20 people in line @ old navy and it does not open for haf an hour. I'm a loser too!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@heartfeltmadnes does this mean you will be on now? U must find me.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@rdmmp nope. The ipod was a hand me down and it lasted a long time. The ps2 was a refurb already. Good deals but oh well!
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@redbadger are they tv or real life boobies?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@waffles08 it's so hard! It's a journey though. And so worth it in the end. You're young, plenty of time :)
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@waffles08 good advice! Wait for the one who wants to stay.

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@megangark what would you rather be doing?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Nap or wow? Hmmm depends on if my body can function on very little sleep today.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@potatoduck whatever works. As long as u are doing it! But just don't be what you hated being. Do you know when u are crossing the line?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@WhooItsScott I got my copy from paperbackswap yesterday. Will read it when I am done with "specials"
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@potatoduck desperation makes us more effective?

tweets_blockaa:1441801	@potatoduck I wanna help. How can I help?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@megangark ha! No life trouble. Lack of being able to find a job here. Entertaining thoughts of moving elsewhere. Can't afford it.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Can't help it. i don't know how much longer I can do this
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Should we just fade away?
tweets_blockaa:1441801	Don't know who to talk to. But I am a little freaked.
tweets_blockaa:1441801	I am trying to be more upbeat but the more we are here, the more I feel like we shouldn't be. I feel trapped. Can't afford to move anywhere
tweets_blockaa:1441801	I think I have kennel cough! *cough cough*
tweets_blockaa:1441801	@megangark yeah and according to commercials for the show, they don't really get along.
