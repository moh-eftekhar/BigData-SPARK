tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove @rshade We're at a point where the national debt is at a record higher and climbing.  At some point economics win.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove @rshade But, he's right.  The money to pay for it wasn't there.  The Dems didn't have it.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade furthermore, he's pointing out the obvious fiscal hypocrisy of the Dems by holding it up.  It worked.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade makes good sense to me, and, yes, the amendment failed but he wanted it in the bill before he ended in the block.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade  http://bit.ly/dykCwK "What was the point of passing pay-go legislation? If Democrats continue to ignore their own rules.."

tweets_blockac:3582641	The question someone is going to have answer at some point is when do jobless benefits end?
tweets_blockac:3582641	@jenniferlucille @rshade but it is the principle of paying for something first that I like.  It's the reason we're in this mess.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@ianrichetti this is true.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade and it worked.  Dems agreed to his demands.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade because he knew it was a paper tiger.  Now he's holding them to it.  Someone's gotta do it.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade Bunning?  He's just making congress do what Obama promised - Pay as you Go.  More power to him.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@ianrichetti I wish congress would take it more seriously rather than the current situation.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@ianrichetti so, if doctors don't have insurance and malpractice occurs, the patient can go after the hospital.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@ianrichetti alot of hospitals require coverage in order to operate.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove agreed.  And he's an orthopaedic surgeon.  The OB/GYN's I know can barely even get insurance.  Most moved to TX.
tweets_blockac:3582641	More power to you Bunning.  Make them do what they say.  Novel idea.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@upsidetrader yeap, me too.  All of the leftist media are going to require a bailout before too long.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove I'm not sure to be honest.  Let's say he takes home 1.2M.  That doesn't change the high cost of the MP insurance.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@upsidetrader yeah, believe it or not Matthews used to sub for Limbaugh many years ago.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@upsidetrader thus the reason Finerman, thought just "Being There" in Argentina made him understand healthcare.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@upsidetrader Right on.
tweets_blockac:3582641	My father-in-law pays $700,000 / year for $900,000 worth of malpractice coverage.  They don't include these stats in tort reform numbers.

tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade oh, haha, I was a big Lewis fan before I ever listened to Limbaugh.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove Hitchens, in his latest book, said his struggle with Atheism was that it was an absolute negative. Lewis had same prob.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade That Wikipedia article is missing alot of references and citations.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade Yes, it was published then.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove Quite possible, a few others would be St. Augustine, Lucretius and G. K. Chesterton.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@rshade Yes, I believe all major works for what he is known for today were written after his conversion from Theism to Christianty.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove I believe "The Great Divorce" was a work which was written before his conversion.  Tolkien had a hand in his conversion.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove relative to his time, of course.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove He was as hardcore as Dawkins is today.  First, he converted to Theism.  Then, years later he converted to Christianity.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove During this time he struggled with believing in an absolute negative so he set out to prove it as an absolute positive.
tweets_blockac:3582641	@mattrehm haha, yeah, being 30 now I do feel older.  Thanks.  :)
tweets_blockac:3582641	@JohnHargrove Lewis was a hardcore atheist.  His goal in life was to spread atheism as he thought religion caused the turmoil in the world.

tweets_blockad:29491253	@RL_Stine The real question is... Why would dying prevent you from continuing to write Goosebumps?
tweets_blockad:29491253	The Japanese are under the impression we eat fried chicken as an x-mas meal.  On x-mas in Japan one needs reservations for KFC.  No joke.
